Source code for a Movie Trailer website.
To run this application, open entertainment_center.py in IDLE and click run module. A static web page will be generated 
featuring my favorite movie's, and their trailers. I finished this project as part of my 
Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree at Udacity.
